about=This plugin rasterizes generic FLO-2D output files with the columns ge, x, y, var. Where ge is grid element, x and y are coordinates, and var is the output data. Use it on any output file such as depth, velocity, and mudflow or sediment transport output. This plugin simplifies and data mapping and catches the data that Mapper and the Mesh tools are missing.
