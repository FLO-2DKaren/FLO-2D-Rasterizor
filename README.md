Rasterizor is a QGIS plugin used to rasterize FLO-2D output data. It is a quick mapping tool for FLO-2D output files. The files should have a standard format with 4 columns ge, x, y, n. These are grid element number, x coordinate, y coordinate, and n is the mapped value. It could be water surface elevation, depth, velocity or time to depth. A brief list of files that can be used are:

- DEPFP.OUT
- DEPTH.OUT
- VELFP.OUT
- TIMEONEFT.OUT
- MAXWSELEV.OUT
- Many others

All FLO-2D output files are listed and described in the Chapter 5 of the Data Input Manual. It is installed on your computer with the software.
